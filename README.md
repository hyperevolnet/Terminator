HyperZ⋅Z⋅W Operator Connects Slow-Fast Networks for Full Context Interaction (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17948.pdf)

~~I'll try to release the code in the near future.~~

~~Unfortunately, the code will not be open source. Thank you for your interest.~~

## Updates

1. Thank Alex Yanko for posting this work on X, which attracted more people's attention.

2. I recommended this work to many famous researchers, but it did not received any response. Therefore, I later decided not to open source the code.

3. I am also looking for more computing resources (16+ 80GB GPUs).
