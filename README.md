# Terminator (unfinished & rechecking...)
 
HyperZ⋅Z⋅W Operator Connects Slow-Fast Networks for Full Context Interaction (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17948.pdf)



## Updates

1. I try to open source all the code in the next two days.

2. I seem to have got better results than before!


### Overall Architecture
- [x] No residual connections
- [x] A new variant of self-attention and FWP to get fast weights - `HyperZ⋅Z⋅W` operator
- [x] A multi-branch structure - `Slow-Fast Neural Encoding (SFNE)` Block
- [x] A local `slow neural loss` to obtain accurate pixel-level scores (i.e. pixel-level "attention")
- [x] `Three new components`: RGU, Hyper-Channel Interaction, Hyper Interaction
- [x] `Excellent Properties`: Faster Training Convergence, Zero-mean Features, Fewer Model Parameters


### Installation

We provide an environment file ``environment.yml`` containing the required dependencies. Clone the repo and run the following command in the root of this directory:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Train

#### Training commands
```shell
python -m models.terminator --mode train
```

#### Testing commands
```shell
python -m models.terminator --mode eval
```

Thank [Alex Yanko](https://x.com/LeopolisDream) for posting this work on X ([twitter](https://x.com/LeopolisDream/status/1804627325583327358)), which attracts more attention. Harvie Zhang independently conducted this project, which commenced in October 2022 and received 1/4 of its funding from Innovation and Technology Fund. Our code is learned from [ccnn](https://github.com/david-knigge/ccnn). We hope our `Terminator` could promote the exploration of novel network architecture.
